int[] duplicate = nums.clone(); // nums is int[] it generates deep copy 

Random rand = new Random();
rand.nextInt(aux.size());

// Map iterator
Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> entries = map.entrySet().iterator();
while (entries.hasNext()) {
    Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry = entries.next();
.....
}


The Integer, String, Float, Double, Byte, Long, Short, Boolean, and Character classes are all examples of an immutable class.
By definition, you may not alter the value of an immutable object after its construction.


Difference between 'public class' and 'class'?
The first one makes it public, that is, visible to any other class. String, HashMap etc are all public classes. 
The second one will result in your class being assigned the default visibility, 
that is package-private (ie: accessible within the same package).

Controlling Access to Members of a Class : 
    What is the difference between 'public, protected, package-private and private' class MEMBERS in Java?
    
            │ Class │ Package │ Subclass │ Subclass │ World

final - 
    1 final class can't be inherited, 
    2 final method can't be overridden in any of the inheriting classes. 
        Methods are made final due to design reasons. 
        Since private methods are inaccessible, they are implicitly final in Java. 
        So adding final specifier to a private method doesn’t add any value.
    3 final variable value can't be changed.

static class - 
You cannot use the static keyword with a class unless it is an inner class.
Static methods can not be overridden: 
    When you defines a static method with same signature as a static method in base class, 
    it is known as method hiding.
        Parent obj1 = new Child(); 
        // As per overriding rules this should call to class Child's staticMethod()  
        // overridden method. Since static method can not be overridden, it  
        // calls Parent's staticMethod()  
        obj1.staticMethod();  
        child's staticMethod() is hidden. 
        
private class - 
You cannot use the private keyword with a class unless it is an inner class.
