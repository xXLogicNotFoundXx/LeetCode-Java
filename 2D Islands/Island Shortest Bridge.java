In a given 2D binary array A, there are two islands. 
(An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s not connected to any other 1s.)
Now, we may change 0s to 1s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.
Return the smallest number of 0s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

1. Find one Island and mark that whole Island as -1 
2. Find second Island and Add ALL positions of the  island in the queue to process for BFS. 
    These all positions are our level one nodes and visited. 
3. Level by level mark positions as visited (Very IMP) 
4. return level 

Time O(M*N) - DFS could traverse all ... BFS could traverse all 
Space O(M*N) - Queue could get almost all M*N positions 


This is another good example that you have to represent the input in a different format to solve the question.
