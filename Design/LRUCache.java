https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
It should support the following operations: get and put.
get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

 * First circular array/queue or even deque sounds good but if the element is accessed then we have to move to the top
   and move other elemensts. so it is not O(1)

 * Priority Queu with the access counter?
    Global counter evrytime any of the method gets called we increase the counter and put that counter in the object.
    Priority queue evict the one that is counter low.
    But we are incrementing the counter and update the counter on get() method
    heapify process wont change that automatically. you have to add or remove the node from the pq. 

 * Linked list sounds good .. we can save refrences in hashtable and move that element to head of the linked list simlliarly
    add new element to the start and remove from end if we want to kick.
    This is promising but we dont have previous pointer to move the element to the start
    We have direct access to pointer but no prev pointer. You may think in the hashmap you can also store prev pointer but
    that previous pointer can change as we add,remove, update the linked list.

 * we can do doubly linked list that way it is easy to ditach the node once you have pointer stored in hashmap
    hash map stores key and DoublyLinkedList node. With prev and next pointer it will be easy to detach that node.

 ** Moreover if you cretae pseudo head and tail in DoublyLinkedList to mark the boundary,
    then we don't need to check the NULL nodes during operations
 ** also there could be put(1,1) then put (1,4) in that case the value should be updated
    and its value and move node to the start.
 ** We also store key in the doubly linkedList node bcz when we evict the
    node we need to know the key to remove it from HashMap.
