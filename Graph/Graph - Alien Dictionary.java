https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/
There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you.
You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this
new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

        // That means we have we have those many parents for a given character.
        // Char with 0 parents would be the first char.
        // Another map says what it connect to map<char,set>
        // once we estabaslish the links and connection count, we start with chars that has no parent for processing in a queue

        // also this is called topological sort
        topological sort - Is the ordering of the nodes depending on the degree of the node. Degree is the count of incoming edges to the node.
