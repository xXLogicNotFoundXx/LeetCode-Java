You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.
-1 -> A wall or an obstacle.
0  -> A gate.
2147483647 -> Infinity means an empty room.
We use the value 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.


Given the 2D grid:

INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4


 The idea is put all indices of '0' value in a queue.
 Start from there and then add neighbouring indices while updating thier distance. (dont process blocks)
 Eventually queue will be empty and we have the ans.
 Simple.

 First i thought i would need Priority Queue but it is not needed.
 Code could be better here.
