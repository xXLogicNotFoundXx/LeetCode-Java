This problem is figuring out that there are two cases .... 

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST),
where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake.
Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Assumption is that we have distinct values.



May be you can do inorder traversal and save in the list.
Then if we find the a[i-1]>a[i] then we can swap that and be done.
^ This doesnt work.
Why?
  1
3       => inorder -> 2,3,1
  2     => we will end up swaping 2 and 3.
           But we need to swap 1 and 3

well may be we need to find two ... positions like a[i-1]>a[i] and swap those.
Which should we swap?
looks like, we take notes of only ith index two times and swap?

will there be always 2 positions like that?
   3
 1    4    => inorder -> 1 3 2 4
     2        There is only one position a[i-1]>a[i] like this .. so we swap 3 and 2

So it could have One OR Two positions like a[i-1]>a[i].
