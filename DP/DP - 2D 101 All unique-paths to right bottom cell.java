Problem 1: 
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 
The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
How many possible unique paths are there?
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

					<= draw this then you will be able to figure it out. 
1 1 1
1 2 3

1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4
1 3 6 10


If you do that, you have to be able to see the pattern -> dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] (top,left)
and 1st row is all 1 and 1st column is all 1.
and that is the algorithm.

If some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2 (two paths around obstacle)


This is also tricky question. You have to realise : 
1 How are you gonna proceed knowing this one is obstacle.
	This i thought may be i can make that obstacle -ve. and then depending on that do calculation
	but that one will be very messy logic. 
	ðŸ˜Ž Better way to put 0 in the cell and move on.â˜º
2 You also need to realise
	1 if there is an obstactle in the first row .. all subsequent positions are gonna be obstacle.
	2 if there is an obstactle in the first column .. all subsequent column positions are gonna be obstacle.



	******** Lesson Learnt *********
	Usually I go and try to define a state with '-ve' number OR some INT_MAX constant. 
		- This is almost all the time ends up being messy and a lot state checking
			- results into not solving the problem at all or taking too much time. 
		- Ends up being lot of if and elses 
		
	Avoid it .... 
	come up with the algorithm .... and 
		- try zero value would that work with genral algorithm?
			- yes then try some corner cases
		-

/* 
	We do need first three loops. Incorporating logic in one i,j loop is not possible (lots of ifs and buts) 
	
	******** Lesson learnt ********* 
	If you think extra for loops can make your life easy, do it. 
	Dont try to get that logic in the main logic.
	Or else just write some extra function init()
