	******** Lesson Learnt *********
	Usually I go and try to define a state with '-ve' number OR some INT_MAX constant. 
		- This is almost all the time ends up being messy and a lot state checking
			- results into not solving the problem at all or taking too much time. 
		- Ends up being lot of if and elses 
		
		^ Avoid it .... 
	come up with the algorithm .... and 
		- try zero value would that work with genral algorithm? ( wors if you adding or subtracting 
			- yes then try some corner cases
		- try one that may help in division/multiplication 
			- yes then try some corner cases
