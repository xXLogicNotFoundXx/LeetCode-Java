Subset/Subarray :
Set of size n elements can form 2^n subsets (superset).
[1,2,3] = [] [1] [2] [3] [1,2] [1,3] [2,3] [1,2,3] = 8 = 2^3


Combination :
n elements with r picks. Cobinations
          n!
nCr =  ---------
       (r!.(n-r)!)


Permutations :

n unique elements

  Permutations = n!


n elements with n1 identical objects of type 1
                â€‹n2 identical objects of type 2

                   n!
  Permutations  ---------
                 n1! n2!
