465. Optimal Account Balancing
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. 
A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
Find minimum transaction needed. 
Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]
    Explanation:
    Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
    Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Output:
2
One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.

we can build a map like who owes money and who need to get the money  (+ve owes money )
0 -> -5
1 -> +10
2 -> -5 
create a list of map.values ->  -5, 10 , -5 

[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Map : 
0 -> 4
1 -> -4
2 -> 0
create a list of map.values ->  4, -4 , 0

Now we can use backtracking with  start=0
and internal loop from i=start+1 to N 
    in loop if we find +ve/-ve OR -ve/+ve cobination for start & i'th 
    that means we have to do transaction. 
    we give ALL start's money to i and then call backtracking function again with (start +1) 
    (as start gave all his money he is clear now & all other (start+1...n) needs to settle ..
    doing this we keep track of minimum transaction needed)

                debt.set(i, newIVal);
                int totalTransacction  = 1 + settle(start + 1, debt); // as start has 0 balance we dont need start anymore.
