https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/
Koko loves to eat bananas.  
There are N piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas.  
The guards have gone and will come back in H hours.
If the pile has more than K bananas, she eats K and then next hr she eat K from the same pile.
If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.
Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.
Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours.


Time Complexity: O(N * log W), where N is the number of piles, and W is the maximum size of a pile.
Space Complexity: O(1).
