        Calculating substring  that would be N^2 and checking if palindrome will ne N
        That would be N^3 and trivial implementation.

        We can use the same logic finding longest palindromic substring
        expand(i,i) and expand(i,i+1) and return the count as we match the characters
        that would reduce complexity to N^2
