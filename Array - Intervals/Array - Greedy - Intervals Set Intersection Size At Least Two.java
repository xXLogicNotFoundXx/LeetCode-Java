An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.
Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has a size of at least two.

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.


We can sort by end points. since every end point is e >=s, it is better to choose 
endPoint and endPoint-1 as a set value. which has higher chances to be in "next inteval".
By using TreeSet we can get floor and ceiling value we can try to find two numbers that are in the interval 
ceiling(start) and floor(end)
OR
you can sort by start timing and iterate from last interval and add start & start+1 

    Sort -> n*LogN
    For each interval we find ceiling and floor N*logN
Time : O (N*LogN)

// all we really need largest and second largest number in set
